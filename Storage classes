/* program about storage classes */
1.Auto storage class:
#include <stdio.h>   //header file include printf and scanf function
int main( )     //program starts from main function
{
  auto int j = 1;   //intilialization of auto varaiable 
  {
    auto int j= 2;   //intilialization of auto varaiable 
    {
      auto int j = 3;  //intilialization of auto varaiable 
      printf ( "%d", j);  //print 3 since it has block  scope
    }
    printf ( " %d",j);  //print 2 since it has local scope
  }
  printf( " %d", j);  //print 1 since it has method scope
    return 0;      //return type
}

output:
3 2 1

2.register:

#include <stdio.h>  //header file include printf and scanf function
  int main()  //program starts from main function
{
   register int x = 5;// initialiazation of x variable(function scope)
   int i;              //declaration of variable i of type int 

   printf("%d\n",x); // 10 will be printed here  because it is the given local value of p
   printf("%d",i);//A variable x has memory allocation in the CPU register. Here, the initial value of i, by default, is 0.

    return 0;  //return type
}
output:
5
34287

3.static:

#include <stdio.h>  //header file include printf and scanf function
int func()
{
static int a=0;//local type of the static variable
int b=0;// local type of auto variable it defaulty takes auto
a++;//incrementing the variable
b++;
printf("a= %d and b= %d\n", a, b);//scope will be within the same block(until the completion of the program a variable will be alive but b disappears)
}
int main() //program execution starts from here
{
func();// calling function
func();
func();
return 0;//return type
}
output:

a= 1 and b= 1
a= 2 and b= 1
a= 3 and b= 1

4. extern

First File: main.c
#include <stdio.h
#include <stdio.h>  //header file include printf and scanf function
extern i;  //declaration of extern variable 
int main()  //main function
{
   printf("value of the external integer is = %d\n", i);  //print 20 since it has initialized in original file
   return 0;   //return type
   }
Second File: original.c
#include<stdio.h>   //header file include printf and scanf function
int i= 20;//through out the program like global it may access
output:

value of the external integer is = 20
